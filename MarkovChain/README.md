# A Simple Markov Chain (Python)

Give the Markov chain a text file and it will be output in a fun, new order.
It will output up to 1,000 words.

# Things to note
Code Language Used: Python

markovEngine.py uses code from the book:
Reed & Zelle Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python and C++

wordsToPredict.txt is the beginning of the book The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.
(It's a great book, but you can change the contents of the file to be whatever text you want.)

# To Run the Markov Chain

1. git clone the repo
1. cd into MarkovChain
1. in your terminal, type:  
`python main.py wordsToPredict.txt`
